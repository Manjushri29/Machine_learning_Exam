Case Study: Vehicle Advertisements Analysis

Section 1: Price Prediction
Problem Statement: Develop a predictive model to estimate the price of a vehicle based on the
provided features.
Tasks:
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:
○ Handle missing values appropriately.
○ Encode categorical variables.
○ Normalize/standardize numerical features if necessary.
2. Feature Selection:
○ Perform correlation analysis to identify relevant features.
○ Apply feature selection techniques such as Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
or Lasso Regression.
3. Model Training:
○ Train at least three different regression models
○ Evaluate the models using cross-validation.
4. Hyperparameter Tuning:
○ Use Grid Search or Random Search for hyperparameter optimization.
5. Model Evaluation:
○ Compare the models based on RMSE, MAE, and R².
○ Select the best-performing model.
Deliverables:
● A detailed report on data preprocessing and feature selection.
● Performance metrics of the trained models.
● A final price prediction model with tuned hyperparameters.
● A brief discussion on the model's strengths and weaknesses.
Section 2: User Segmentation
Problem Statement: Segment users based on their advertisement behaviors and
characteristics.
Tasks:
1. Data Preprocessing:
○ Handle missing values.
○ Encode categorical variables.
2. Feature Selection:
○ Use PCA to reduce dimensionality if necessary.
○ Select relevant features for clustering.
3. Clustering:
○ Apply K-means clustering to segment users.
○ Experiment with different numbers of clusters and evaluate using the Elbow
Method and Silhouette Score.
4. Cluster Analysis:
○ Interpret and describe the characteristics of each cluster.
○ Identify any patterns or insights about user behavior.
Deliverables:
● A detailed report on data preprocessing and feature selection.
● Visualization of the clusters and their characteristics.
● A description of each user segment and potential business implications.
Section 3: Geographical Analysis of Demand and Supply
Problem Statement: Analyze the geographical distribution of vehicle advertisements to
understand demand and supply patterns.
Tasks:
1. Data Preprocessing:
○ Handle missing values.
○ Encode geographical variables.
2. Geographical Analysis:
○ Visualize the distribution of advertisements across different regions.
○ Identify regions with high demand and supply.
3. Temporal Analysis:
○ Analyze how demand and supply vary over time in different regions.
○ Identify any seasonal trends or patterns.
4. Modeling Demand and Supply:
○ Develop a regression model to predict demand and supply based on
geographical and temporal features.
○ Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics.
Deliverables:
● Visualizations of geographical and temporal trends in demand and supply.
● A detailed report on the findings from the geographical analysis.
● Performance metrics of the demand and supply prediction model.
● Insights and recommendations based on the analysis
